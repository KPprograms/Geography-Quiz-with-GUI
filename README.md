# Geography-Quiz-with-GUI
This is a continuation to my earlier project of the geography quiz. In this version I use tkinter to implement a GUI into the same quiz to make it more user friendly. Multiple levels are not implemented, but the same level has been made into a GUI.

Program: Geography Quiz (Guess the Capital City)
Language: Python
